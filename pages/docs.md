## Original version of Child Support Calculator

The child support portion of the project is based entirely on an older pre-existing project built by HotDocs. This version should continue to be used heavily as a reference as necessary.

It is best to create an account, and fill out the tools to completion so that you can go back and reference different portions of the application.

**Note:** we have found numerous oddities in this tool, and even a few seeming miscalculations. It should be used as a primary reference, but if something seems "wrong" it probably is and can be corrected as needed in this new version.

## Montana State Forms

These are the relevant Montana child support forms and documentation in PDF format. The end goal of the calculator tool is to produce downloadable/printable versions of these completed documents based. 

* [Child Support Worksheets A-E](https://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/csed/documents/guidelinesworksheetsA-E.pdf) -- these are the forms used for all calculations, and forms Worksheet A and the optional Worksheet B are returned for the user to print. The others are used for various calculations as needed. The PDF version of worksheet is mostly complete, but Worksheet B still needs conversion to a fillable PDF.

* [Worksheet Instructions](https://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/csed/documents/GuidelineINSTRUCTIONS-GL-2016.pdf) -- these are the worksheet instructions for completing various steps in Worksheets A-E.

* [Guideline Tables](https://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/csed/documents/cs404-2CSGuidelinesTables.pdf) -- a few calculations are derived using the current tax rate based on the number of children, and also mileage rates. These are referrred to in the Worksheet Instructions and available here as Tables 1-3. 

* [Financial Affadavit Form](https://dphhs.mt.gov/Portals/85/csed/documents/financialaffidavit.pdf) -- this is a direct link to the Financial Affadivit doc for tha t portion of the calculator. 

* [Example of Completed Form from current tool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ujR5gCvx9IBF3jFh37aKM2ajtj1yAAu/view?usp=sharing) -- this is an example of a fully completed form from the existing HotDocs site that shows both "Attachments" and Worksheet B.


## Other docs

* [MT Online Calculators Text Edits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IrZc_PDgFtfsX_L9FEs93Zu4wFKvWzmu8vMzrAc1Kmk/edit?usp=sharing) -- this is a client-facing doc where they were originally submitting text changes and feature requests. Many but not all of these are complete, but some are open issues that may need additional client feedback. EC will finish curating this list and create new tasks as necessary.

* [Original discovery doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vQzoOqLfnKrDjS_Yw8ZAISVgVwsozhMgekUZcHHhmz8/edit?usp=sharing) -- this is the original tech discovery doc with links to meeting notes and other historical docs (probably not relevant moving forward.)
